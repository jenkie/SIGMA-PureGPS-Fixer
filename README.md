# SIGMA-PureGPS-Fixer
Script to fix inaccurate track records from Sigma Pure  GPS bike computer

Usage
1. Export your track as .slf from Sigma Data Center
2. Run script on the file
3. Import generated outfile into Sigma Data Center. The original track record is automatically updated, since it has the sam GUID as the file generated by this script

I recommend Pycharm as IDE and Anaconda 3 as Python distribution
